\begin{questions}
\question Given a group $G$ and a subset $X\subseteq G$, set $\langle X \rangle = \bigcap\{H\leq G \mid H\supseteq X\}$ and let $W$ be the set of elements of $G$ that can be written as words in $X^{\pm}$. Prove that $W=\langle X \rangle$.

\question Let $G$ and $H$ be groups, and $\theta,\phi\colon G\to H$ homomorphisms, and let $X\subseteq G$ be such that $G=\langle X \rangle$. Prove that if $\theta,\phi$ agree on $X$ (i.e. $x\theta=x\phi$, $\forall x\in X$) then $\theta=\phi$ (i.e. $g\theta=g\phi$, $\forall g\in G$).

\question Prove directly from the definition that the infinite cyclic group $Z=\{x^n \mid n\in\Z\}$ is free of rank 1.

\question (H. Smith) Let $F$ be free of rank $r$ and $G$ a group isomorphic to $F$. Show that $G$ is free of rank $r$.

\question Given a group $G$ and a normal subgroup $N\lhd G$ with $G/N=F$ a free group, prove that $G$ has a subgroup $C$ such that
  \[ N \cap C = \{e\},\ NC = G,\ C\simeq F. \]

\question How many reduced words are there of length $l$ in the free group of rank $r$? How many of these are cyclically reduced?

\question Show that the free abelian group of rank $r$ is isomorphic to the direct product of $r$ copies of $Z$.

\question Let $F$ be free of rank $r$. Show that $F/F'$ is free abelian of rank $r$.

\question Prove that the free group $F$ of finite rank $r$ has only a finite number of normal subgroups of index $n\in\N$. [\emph{Hint:} Consider homomorphisms from $F$ onto groups $G$ of order $n$.] Is the same true for arbitrary subgroups (not necessarily normal) of index $n$?

\question Let $F$ be free on a subset $X\subseteq F$, and let $Y$ be a subset of $X$. Prove that the subgroup $H=\langle Y \rangle\leq F$ is free on the set $Y$.

\question Let $F$ be free on $\{x,y\}$ and define $a_n=x^{-n}yx^n$, $n\in\N$. Prove that no reduced word in $a_1,\ldots,a_r$ ($r\in\N$) can be equal to $e$, and deduce that the group $F_r\coloneqq\langle a_1,\ldots,a_r \rangle$ is free on these generators. Show that the group $F_0=\bigcup_{r\in\N} F_r = \langle \{x_n \mid n\in\N\} \rangle$ is free of rank $\aleph_0$.

\question Prove that two elements $a,b$ in a free group $F$ are conjugate in $F$ if and only if $\check{a}$ and $\check{b}$ (as defined in (5)) are cyclic rearrangements of one another, that is, if $\check{a}=x_1\ldots x_l$, then $\check{b}=x_r\ldots x_lx_1\ldots x_{r-1}$ for some $r$, $1\leq r\leq l$.

\question Prove that, in a free group $F$, no non-trivial element can be conjugate to its inverse. Deduce that if $H=\langle a \rangle$ is an infinite cyclic subgroup of $F$, then $N(H)=C(a)$, where $N(H)=\{w\in F \mid w^{-1}Hw=H \}$ is the normalizer of $H$ in $F$.

\question Show that no word $w\neq e$ in a free group can be conjugate to a proper power of itself, namely, to $w^n$ where $n\in\Z$ and $n\neq1$.

\question Prove that the set of reduced words of even length in $F=F(\{x,y\})$ forms a subgroup, call it $H$. Show that $H$ is generated by the elements
  \[ a = x^2, b = xy, c = xy^{-1}. \]
  Verify that if $w$ is one of the 30 reduced words of length 2 in $\{a,b,c\}^\pm$, then the process of expressing $w$ as a reduced word in $\{x,y\}^\pm$ cannot involve the cancellation of the second letter of $a$, $b$ or $c$, nor of the first letter of $a^{-1}$, $b^{-1}$, $c^{-1}$. Thus show that if $w$ is a reduced word of length $l$ in $\{a,b,c\}^{\pm}$, then as a reduced word in $\{x,y\}^\pm$, its length is at least $l$. Deduce that $H$ is a free group of rank 3.

\question Generalise Exercise 15 from rank 2 to rank $r$, that is, find a set of free generators for the group of reduced words of even length in $F(\{x_1,\ldots,x_r\})$.

\question For a fixed $l,r\in\N$, what can you say about the group generated by the reduced words of length $l$ in the free group of rank $r$?

\question The \emph{centre} of any group $G$ is defined by
  \[ Z(G) \coloneqq \{ z\in G \mid zg=gz,\ \forall g\in G\}. \]
  Prove that the center of every non-cyclic free group is trivial.

\question Prove that no finite group can be the union of the conjugates of a proper subgroup.

\question (J. Wiegold) In the free group $F=F(\{a,b\})$ of rank 2, let
  \[ A = \{ a_k \mid k\in\N \} \]
  be an enumeration of those reduced words that begin and end with a power of $a$. Prove that if
  \[ B = \{b^{-k}a_kb^k \mid k\in\N \}, \]
  then the subgroup $H=\langle B \rangle$ is free on $B$. Deduce that $H<F$, but $\bigcup_{w\in F} H^w=F$.
