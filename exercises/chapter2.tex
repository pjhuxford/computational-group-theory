\begin{questions}
\question Prove that the relation $<$ of Definition 2 satisfies (o1), (o2), (o4).

\question What is the 666th element of $F=F(\{x,y\})$ in the ordering (1)?

\question With the same $F$ and $<$, what is the second smallest element of the commutator subgroup $F'$?

\question With the same $F$ and $<$ again, let $H=\overline{S}$ with $S=\{x^4, y^2, (xy)^2\}$. Show that $\abs{F:H}=8$ (using $D_4$) and write down a Schreier transversal for $H$ in $F$. Compile a table like Table 1, and thus obtain a basis $B$ of $H$.

\question Prove that the permutations $x_1=(12)$, $x_2=(23)$, $x_3=(34)$ generate the symmetric group $S_4$. Use the transversal $U=\{e,x_1\}$ of the alternating group $A_4$ to find Schreier generators for $A_4$.

\question Convince yourself that $U=\{x^ky^l \mid k,k\in\Z\}$ is a Schreier transversal for $F'$ in $F=F(\{x,y\})$. Write down the corresponding Schreier generators for $F'$ and express the commutator $x^{-2}y^{-3}x^2y^3$ in terms of them.

\question Prove that every subgroup of finite index in a finitely-generated group is finitely generated.

\question Express each of the seven free generators in the left half of Table 1 as products of conjugates of $a=x^3$, $b=y^2$, $c=x^{-1}y^{-1}xy$.

\question Prove that the free group of rank 2 contains a free subgroup of any given finite rank as a normal subgroup.

\question Prove Euler's formula for planar graphs: let $\Gamma$ have $v$ vertices, $e$ edges (all straight line segments) and $f$ faces (polygonal regions bounded by edges of $\Gamma$ and containing no vertices of $\Gamma$ in their interiors). Then $v-e+f$ is equal to one more than the number of connected components of $\Gamma$.

\question Use the Nielsen-Schreier theorem and the result of Exercise 1.18 to give a quick proof of Theorem 1.2.

\question Let $F=F(X)$ be an arbitrary free group, and $H\leq F$ the subgroup consisting of words of even length. Use Schreier's method to obtain a basis for $H$ (cf. Exx. 1.15, 1.16).

\question (M. Hall, Jr.) Let $F=F(X)$ be a free group of finite rank $\abs{X}=r$, and let $n\in\N$ be a fixed natural number. Prove that $F$ contains only finitely many $n$-element Schreier sets, and that if $U$ is one of these, the number of functions $U\times X\to U$ is finite. Deduce that $F$ has only finitely many subgroups of index $n$.

\question Use the previous exercise to show that a finitely-generated group has only finitely many subgroups of a given finite index.
