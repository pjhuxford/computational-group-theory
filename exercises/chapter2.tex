\begin{questions}
\question Prove that the relation $<$ of Definition 2 satisfies (o1), (o2), (o4).
  \begin{solution}
    Let $s=x_1\cdots x_l$, $t=y_1\cdots y_m$, $u=z_1\cdots z_n$ be reduced words in $X^\pm$. Since $l\not <l$, and $x_i=x_i$ for $1\leq i\leq r$, we have not ($s<s$), thus (O1) is satisfied.

    Suppose that $s<t$ and $t<u$. Then $l\leq m\leq n$, so if either $l<m$ or $m<n$, then $l<n$, and so $s<u$. Otherwise $l=m=n$, $x_r<y_r$ for $r=\min\{i \mid x_i\neq y_i\}$, and $y_{r'}<z_{r'}$ for $r'=\min\{j \mid y_j\neq z_j\}$. Note $x_i=y_i=z_i$ for all $1\leq i<\min\{r,r'\}$

    If $\min\{r,r'\}=r$, then $x_r<y_r\leq z_r$, so that $s<u$. If $\min\{r,r'\}=r'$, then $x_{r'}\leq y_{r'}<z_{r'}$, so that $s<u$. In all cases $s<u$, so (O2) is satisfied.

    Let $S$ be a non-empty subset of $F$, and define $n=\min\{l(s) \mid s\in S\}\subseteq\N$. We inductively define a sequence $S_1,\ldots,S_n$ of non-empty subsets of $X^\pm$. Let $i\geq1$, and suppose $S_1,\ldots,S_{i-1}$ have been defined. Set $x_j=\min S_j$, for $1\leq j<i$. Define
    \[ S_i = \{ x\in X^\pm \mid x_1\cdots x_{i-1}xy_{i+1}\cdots y_n \in S\text{ is reduced, for some } y_j\in X^\pm \}. \]
    Since $S$ contains a reduced word of length $n$, it follows that $S_1$ is non-empty. For $i>1$, suppose that $S_j$ is non-empty for each $1\leq j<i$. Then the definitions $x_j=\min S_j$ make sense, and moreover for each $x\in S_{i-1}$, there exists a reduced word $x_1\cdots x_{i-2}xy_i\cdots y_n\in S$. Taking $x=x_{i-1}$ shows that $S_i$ is non-empty.

    If we finally define $x_n=\min S_n$, then we claim that the word $s=x_1\cdots x_n$ is the least element of $S$. By definition, $x_1\cdots x_{n-1}x$ is reduced and in $S$ for each $x\in S_n$. Taking $x=x_n$ shows that $s$ is a reduced word of length $n$. Let $t=y_1\cdots y_m\in S$ be a reduced word. Then $n\leq m$ by definition of $n$. If $n<m$, then $s<t$.

    Suppose that $n=m$, and that $s\neq t$. Let $r=\min\{i \mid x_i\neq y_i\}$. Then $x_r\neq y_r\in S_r$, and thus $x_r=\min S_r<y_r$, hence $s<t$. It follows that $S$ has a least element, $s$. Therefore (O4) is satisfied.
  \end{solution}

\question What is the 666th element of $F=F(\{x,y\})$ in the ordering (1)?
  \begin{solution}
    By Exercise \textbf{1.6}, for $l\geq1$ there are $4\cdot3^{l-1}$ words of length $l$ in $F$, and hence there are
    \[ 1+4(1+\cdots+3^{l-1})=1+4\cdot\frac{3^l-1}{3-1}=2\cdot3^l-1 \]
    words of length at most $l$ in $F$. Thus there are $2\cdot3^5-1=485$ words of length at most 5 in $F$. The ordering the question refers orders the elements first by length, and then lexicographically according to the ordering $x<y<x^{-1}<y^{-1}$ on $X^\pm$.

    There are $2\cdot 3^4=162$ reduced words of length 6 beginning with either $x^2$ or $xy$, as in each case there are 3 choices for each of the 4 subsequent letters. Similarly there are $2\cdot3^2=18$ reduced words of length 6 beginning with either $xy^{-1}x^2$ or $xy^{-1}xy$.

    The words described so far make up the first $485+162+18=665$ words in $F$. Therefore the 666th word in $F$ is $xy^{-1}xy^{-1}x^2$.
  \end{solution}

\question With the same $F$ and $<$, what is the second smallest element of the commutator subgroup $F'$?
  \begin{solution}
    By Exercise \textbf{1.8}, $F/F'$ is free abelian of rank 2 on $\{F'x,F'y\}$, and by Exercise \textbf{1.7}, $F/F'\cong Z\times Z$, where $Z$ is the infinite cyclic group $\{x^n \mid n\in\Z\}$, via the isomorphism determined by $F'x\mapsto(x,1)$ and $F'y\mapsto(1,x)$.

    The composite mapping $F\twoheadrightarrow F/F'\to Z\times Z$ has kernel $F'$, and is determined by $x\mapsto(x,1)$ and $y\mapsto(1,x)$. It follows that this map sends a word $w$ to $(x^{e_1},x^{e_2})$, where $e_1$ and $e_2$ are the sums of exponents of $x$-terms and $y$-terms in the word $w$.

    Therefore, elements of $F$ are reduced words which have the same number of occurrences of $x$ and $x^{-1}$ letters, and the same number of $y$ and $y^{-1}$ letters. Thus, the second smallest element of $F'$ is $xyx^{-1}y^{-1}=[x,y]$.
  \end{solution}

\question With the same $F$ and $<$ again, let $H=\overline{S}$ with $S=\{x^4, y^2, (xy)^2\}$. Show that $\abs{F:H}=8$ (using $D_4$) and write down a Schreier transversal for $H$ in $F$. Compile a table like Table 1, and thus obtain a basis $B$ of $H$.

\question Prove that the permutations $x_1=(12)$, $x_2=(23)$, $x_3=(34)$ generate the symmetric group $S_4$. Use the transversal $U=\{e,x_1\}$ of the alternating group $A_4$ to find Schreier generators for $A_4$.

\question Convince yourself that $U=\{x^ky^l \mid k,k\in\Z\}$ is a Schreier transversal for $F'$ in $F=F(\{x,y\})$. Write down the corresponding Schreier generators for $F'$ and express the commutator $x^{-2}y^{-3}x^2y^3$ in terms of them.

\question Prove that every subgroup of finite index in a finitely-generated group is finitely generated.

\question Express each of the seven free generators in the left half of Table 1 as products of conjugates of $a=x^3$, $b=y^2$, $c=x^{-1}y^{-1}xy$.

\question Prove that the free group of rank 2 contains a free subgroup of any given finite rank as a normal subgroup.

\question Prove Euler's formula for planar graphs: let $\Gamma$ have $v$ vertices, $e$ edges (all straight line segments) and $f$ faces (polygonal regions bounded by edges of $\Gamma$ and containing no vertices of $\Gamma$ in their interiors). Then $v-e+f$ is equal to one more than the number of connected components of $\Gamma$.

\question Use the Nielsen-Schreier theorem and the result of Exercise 1.18 to give a quick proof of Theorem 1.2.

\question Let $F=F(X)$ be an arbitrary free group, and $H\leq F$ the subgroup consisting of words of even length. Use Schreier's method to obtain a basis for $H$ (cf. Exx. 1.15, 1.16).

\question (M. Hall, Jr.) Let $F=F(X)$ be a free group of finite rank $\abs{X}=r$, and let $n\in\N$ be a fixed natural number. Prove that $F$ contains only finitely many $n$-element Schreier sets, and that if $U$ is one of these, the number of functions $U\times X\to U$ is finite. Deduce that $F$ has only finitely many subgroups of index $n$.

\question Use the previous exercise to show that a finitely-generated group has only finitely many subgroups of a given finite index.
